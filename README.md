# Documentation and user manual  üóí.

It's a very basic and easy to use image search using google image search API.

<hr>

## Why I created this? üßê.

I am learing how to use google image search API using python to create a simple image search application.

You can also watch some of the exciting projects on my github account.

# Installation and Basic requirements.

### Basic requirements.

- For this project you will be simply need to install some pip packages like `pip install -q gradio` and `pip install "tf-nightly"`. 
- For best result i'll recommend you to use 'Google Colab'.
- üõë Please note that 'Google Colab' has it's own GPU and TPU so in most of the cases you'll not required to install `pip install tensorflow`.
- A keyboard and mouse.
- An image containing the monument that you want to search.
- Active internet connection.

### Installation and usages.

- For proper functioning please install 'gradio and tensorflow'

- Import all the required modules for proper functioning.

- # Make sure to install all the modules and 'gradio modules' before interpreting.

- Importing all the required trained API for image recognisation.
- This module is trained only for some common places in Asian subcontinent.

- Please make sure that you have used the 2d array as (321,321), othewise it'll show error in the next step.

- Please make sure to keep the images in the same directory or in same folder with the name as enterd in the program.

- üõë Otherwise it'll show some errors.

- Now run next command to check whether the image containing directory is mounted properly or not.

- üü¢ If it shows the image then it means that all the process is going correctly.
- Now we'll check for array size and verify that wether it satisfy the array size of (321,321) or not.

- In this case both of it satisfy the array value (321,321).
- Now we'll predict the location by using the predict option of tensorflow and also using google API.

- Here our tensor flow model sucessfully discovered the image as 'India gate'.
- As it is an open source project and other user can also insert their image for searching.
- That's why there's an UI for easy user interaction.

- When we'll click the link of Gradio in the last block then it'll open a new tab where we can insert the new image or the place you want to search.
